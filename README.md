# Item Mover Bot
A PIC16F887 based robot that is able to navigate its environment and move an item using an attached robotic arm.

## Features
Ultrasonic Wall Detection (navigation)<br>Infared Line Detection (navigation & target detection)<br>Photoresistor Item Color Detection (detecting the item to be moved based on color<br> <br>TT Gear Motors + Motor Driver (movement)<br> <br>Servos for arm mechanism (item pickup)<br> <br>LCD Display for debug / info display (misc)<br>Homemade PCB boards<br> <br>App control (luxury)<br>Bluetooth Capability (luxury)

# The Hardware
The hardware of this robot consists of 3D printed + wooden parts to form the body and mechanisms of the robot. For the electronics, a homemade Printed Circuit Board was made. 

## The Programming
The code for this project is written in C, using the MPLab ecosystem.
Since there aren't really any pre-made libraries out there, most of the stuff (LCD, Servo, etc) I had to program from scratch using the datasheets.
If you would like to access these libraries, I would be happy to provide them for you. Please send me an email at xsmu0922@gmail.com.

## Video
When the project is finished, I'll be making a video. <br>

#### Credits & Inspiration
This robot was inspired by a robot I saw during Tesla's factory tour.
